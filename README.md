# voice-recorder-app
This is an Android app, that I implemented using a TVAC Studio tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhQwbJ-1iNs&list=PLGCjwl1RrtcQWt6CjKXqK4SoFAd3imSdX).

User can:
* Record own voice
* Replay all recordings (including stop, pause, resume, replay functionality)

While I was following the tutorial I worked with:
* Material Design, different UI components, custom animations, vast range of listeners
* Fragments
* Navigation Components from Android Jetpack
* Creating a custom Adapter for RecyclerView
* MediaPlayer

In addition to the basic version, I added my own functionality too:
